Algorithm:
	My algorithm is composed of a simulation loop which runs until user enters exit or presses control c
inside the simulation loop. A variety of condition statements will test the first argument and check to see
if it matches with any of the hardcoded commands, if it doesn't it will go through the exec function.



	To run program use make command, and then ./msh to run the executable
